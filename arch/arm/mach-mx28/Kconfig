	help
		You should select yes unless you know what you are doing.  We normally
		use kernel command line arguments to set the NAND partition information.
		However, the Freescale platform code creates a 20 Megabyte boot partition
		by default, and this will interfere with the partition settings on the
		command line.  So if you want to set the NAND partitions on the kernel
		command line, then set this option to y.  We normally do this for the
		cpx2 platform.
