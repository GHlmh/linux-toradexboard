* Freescale's NFC (nand flash controller)

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,XXX-nfc"
- reg : Address range of the mtd chip
- interrupts: Should contain the STMMAC interrupts
- nand-bus-width: see nand.txt
- nand-ecc-mode: see nand.txt
- nand-on-flash-bbt: see nand.txt
- clock-frequency : Optional clock rate to NFC in Hz
- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
  representing partitions.

Example:

	nfc: nand@400e0000 {
		compatible = "fsl,vf610-nfc";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x400e0000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <0 83 0x04>;
		clocks = <&clks VF610_CLK_NFC>;
		clock-names = "nfc";
		clock-frequency = <33000000>;
	};
