 *
 * Arguments:
 *      digi        pointer to context information
 *      address     set to BB_AES_FIFO, BB_FIFO, or BEACON_FIFO.  Setting to
 *                  BEACON_FIFO indicates that we are loading a beacon.
 *      buf         pointer to buffer to write into the FIFO.  The buffer
 *                  is not necessarily aligned.
 *      len         number of bytes in the buffer.
 *
 * Return Values
 *      0           success
 *                  (nonzero return value would be possible with USB version)

 * Write a value to a Piper register.  This function takes an operations

 *
 * 1.  We want to maintain some compatibility with the USB driven

 * 2.  If we do the logical operations seperately, for example read a register,
 *     or the value with the result, and then write, we run the risk of
 *     some other thread interrupting us between the read and the write.
 *     By doing both in this function we can protect the operation with
