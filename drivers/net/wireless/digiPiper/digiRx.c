/*
 * This routine is called to receive a frame.  The hardware header has
 * already been read from the FIFO.  We need to read out the frame.  If
 * the frame was encrypted with AES and we have the correct key, then
 * we use the AES H/W encryption engine to decrypt the frame.  We also
 * set up a ieee80211_rx_status structure with the appropriate info.
 *
 * Arguments
 *      digi                context information
 *      skb                 empty buffer to receive packet into
 *      length              number of bytes in FIFO
 *      frameControlField   buffer to copy frame control header into
 *      status              status structure we must write status into
 *      
 * Returns
