	  This option adds the support for the Flexible Interfaces Modules (FIM).
	  Currently only the NS921X processors are supporting the FIM-devices. 
          The number of available FIMs is two for NS9215 and one for NS9210.

	  For installing the specific FIM-firmware, the FIM core driver depends on
	  Hotplug and the firmware-subsystem too. 

##           If a FIM-driver is selected as loadable module, then is required
##           to have installed the user-space application 'mdev' (Busybox).
